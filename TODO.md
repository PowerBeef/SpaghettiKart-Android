# SpaghettiKart Bug Fixes and Optimizations TODO

## üö® High Priority (Security) - CRITICAL ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Fix buffer overflow in render_player.c** - Replace unsafe `strcpy()` calls with bounds-checked alternatives

- [x] **Fix buffer overflow in Course.cpp** - Replace `strcpy()` with `strncpy()` for asset loading
  - **Fixed**: `strcpy()` replaced with `strncpy()` using allocated buffer size with null termination
- [x] **Fix format string vulnerability in debug.c** - Replace `sprintf()` with `snprintf()`
  - **Fixed**: `sprintf()` replaced with `snprintf()` using `CHARACTER_BUFFER_SIZE` (200) buffer limit
- [x] **Fix memory leak in Engine.cpp** - Add `free()` for `fontDataPtr` after font loading
  - **Fixed**: Added proper error handling and `free()` call after ImGui font loading

## üîß Medium Priority (Stability)
- [ ] **Improve error handling in ModelLoader.cpp** - Add proper error handling for malloc failures
- [ ] **Fix aggressive thread error handling** - Replace `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` with graceful degradation
- [ ] **Add null pointer checks** - Review and add missing null checks throughout codebase
- [ ] **Fix array bounds issues** - Replace hardcoded sizes with `sizeof()` and proper bounds checking

## ‚ö° Low Priority (Performance)
- [ ] **Optimize nested loops in menu_items.c** - Improve performance of menu rendering loops
- [ ] **Batch memory operations in audio/mixer.c** - Reduce redundant memcpy operations
- [ ] **Optimize string operations in MultiplayerWindow.cpp** - Use more efficient string handling
- [ ] **Standardize error handling patterns** - Create consistent error handling across codebase

## üßπ Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] **Address TODO comments** - 458 TODO/FIXME comments need review and prioritization
- [ ] **Replace magic numbers** - Use named constants for hardcoded values
- [ ] **Improve documentation** - Add proper documentation for complex functions
- [ ] **Standardize memory management** - Choose between manual and RAII patterns consistently

## üìã Detailed Issues

### Security Issues
1. **Buffer Overflow in render_player.c**
   - Location: Lines 291-320, 314-320, 351-355, etc.
   - Issue: Multiple unsafe `strcpy()` calls without bounds checking
   - Risk: High - potential buffer overflows leading to crashes or code execution

2. **Buffer Overflow in Course.cpp**
   - Location: Line 199
   - Issue: `strcpy(reinterpret_cast<char*>(freeMemory), asset->addr)` without length validation
   - Risk: High - buffer overflow if asset->addr is longer than allocated space

3. **Format String Vulnerability in debug.c**
   - Location: Line 44
   - Issue: `sprintf(cBuffer, "%.3f", *(f32*) &variable)` without buffer size validation
   - Risk: Medium - potential buffer overflow

4. **Memory Leak in Engine.cpp**
   - Location: Lines 654-656
   - Issue: `malloc()` allocated memory for `fontDataPtr` is never freed
   - Risk: Medium - memory leak on every font load

### Stability Issues
5. **Missing Error Handling in ModelLoader.cpp**
   - Location: Lines 45-56
   - Issue: `malloc()` failures are logged but function continues execution
   - Risk: Medium - potential null pointer dereferences

6. **Aggressive Thread Error Handling**
   - Location: src/networking/networking.c:82-89
   - Issue: Thread creation failure causes `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`
   - Risk: Medium - application termination instead of graceful degradation

7. **Array Bounds Issues**
   - Location: src/menu_items.c:1507
   - Issue: Hardcoded array sizes that may not match actual usage
   - Risk: Medium - potential buffer overflows

### Performance Issues
8. **Nested Loop Inefficiencies**
   - Location: src/menu_items.c:3360-3395
   - Issue: Nested loops with fixed step sizes (0x20) that could be optimized
   - Risk: Low - performance impact

9. **Redundant Memory Operations**
   - Location: src/audio/mixer.c (multiple locations)
   - Issue: Multiple `memcpy()` operations that could be batched
   - Risk: Low - performance impact

10. **Inefficient String Operations**
    - Location: src/port/ui/MultiplayerWindow.cpp:40-42
    - Issue: `strncpy()` followed by manual null termination
    - Risk: Low - minor inefficiency

## üéØ Implementation Priority
1. **Immediate (This Week)**: Fix all High Priority security issues
2. **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**: Address Medium Priority stability issues
3. **Medium Term (Next Month)**: Implement Low Priority performance optimizations
4. **Long Term (Ongoing)**: Code quality improvements and TODO resolution

## üìä Progress Tracking
- **Total Issues**: 14 major categories
- **Critical Security**: 4 issues ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- **Stability**: 3 issues  
- **Performance**: 3 issues
- **Code Quality**: 4 issues
- **TODO Comments**: 458 (needs prioritization)

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FIXES**
1. **Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities** - Fixed 6 instances across 2 files
2. **Format String Vulnerability** - Fixed 1 instance in debug.c
3. **Memory Leak** - Fixed font memory leak in Engine.cpp
4. **Error Handling** - Added null pointer checks and proper error handling

## üîç Code Review Notes
- Codebase is a port/emulation project with legacy C patterns mixed with modern C++
- Most critical issues are buffer overflow vulnerabilities and memory leaks
- Threading implementation needs improvement for better error handling
- Memory management patterns are inconsistent and should be standardized
